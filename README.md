# Cheap-Flights-Tracker

This program will either text or email the user a list of cheap flights for any locations that they want to travel to.  All the user has to do is fill out a Google Sheets doc that has 3 columns (City, IATA Code, Max Price).  The code will then either text or email the user any flights for those locations that are less than the Max Price.
